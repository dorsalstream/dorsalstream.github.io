Supposed to be for productive procrastination, by a graduate student, so as to get into a habit of writing regularly. But it is not. Though I try. If you wish to give me a shout out and know how to get in touch with me, do get in touch with me, with thoughts, suggestions and what not. If you don't know how to get in touch with me, and have made up your mind that you must get in touch with me, you can try contacting me through [G+](https://plus.google.com/100909387498133159339/) or drop a note on the [tweety](https://twitter.com/mehtadushy).


The site is based on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and [Hyde](http://mdo.github.io/hyde) and hosted at GitHub. Go check them out if you wish to acquire a similar setup for yourself.
