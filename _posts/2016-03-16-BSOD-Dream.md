*Coasting through la la land. Reverie cuts to BSOD. Panic! Half awake. Systems coming back online.*

*Am I really a robot? I have questions!! Windows on a robot? Why am I a robot? ..*

This is going to be an examination of this particular dream and the consequent recognition of the need for establishing processes in workflow and life. Check out other stuff if you deem this mundane. You have been forewarned.   

Our brains are fantastic at weaving narratives around our experiences and stimuli. The ingredients for this particular one were sunlight streaming in on my face as I slept, neural adaptation on the red light filtered through my eyelids, and having listened to a whole bunch of the fantastic [Hello Internet](https://www.youtube.com/user/HelloInternetPodcast/videos) podcasts in the days leading up to this. All it took was a turn of the head away from the direct light for neural adaptation to cause my entire visual field to go blue.

Coming out of my panicked and confused state, questioning if I was a robot, I realized that I already know that humans are meat robots. Just incredibly terrible at all things positively associated with being robotic, and confoundingly irrational. This makes following structured processes and rituals, compiled and revised in moments of rational lucidity, all the more important for optimal functioning of the self. Optimality, of course, defined per individual's desires and happiness.

This is incredibly obvious and has been the staple of productivity guides for ages, and yet is incredibly hard to convey to others without them stumbling upon the realization themselves, much that same way it is with the benefits of exercise (Brady and Grey touch upon this in one of their podcasts). 

So taking inspiration from Grey's allegedly robotic approach to work and life, I am going to incorporate checklists and note-keeping as a part of my workflow. I used to do that. I wonder why I stopped?
I would start with Computer Vision and Data Processing checklists, adding items to them as and when I come across useful insights. I hope to extend this to personal habits too, ritualizing morning and evening routines for optimality of mental and physical well being.

I would, in due time, put up some of the technical checklists so that others may improve upon or benefit from it.

Until next time.
