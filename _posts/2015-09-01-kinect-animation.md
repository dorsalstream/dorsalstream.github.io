Welcome to **Dorsal Stream**. We'll kick off the blog with a post about using Kinect as a motion capture device to drive a humanoid mesh. The main purpose of the post is to talk a bit about the math of *skeletal animations*, document some quirks of *Kinect* and introduce a naive method for *motion retargeting*.
